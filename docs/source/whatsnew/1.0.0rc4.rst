1.0.0rc4 (Estimated October, 2020)
----------------------------------

This is the forth 1.0 release candidate.


API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~



Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Allow users to render reports without full access to the time series data of
  the report's forecasts and observations. Users with limited permissions on a
  report may need to instantiate a
  :py:class:`solarforecastarbiter.datamode.Report` object from an api response
  from the `/reports` endpoint manually. (:pull:`585`)

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
* Allow for scaling of x axis tick frequency on report metric plots to avoid
  crowding for *date* category. (:issue:`578`) (:pull:`581`)
* Fix spacing of plot titles to avoid long names running out of container and
  Plotly toolbar overlap. (:issue:`577`) (:pull:`581`)
* Dynamically calculate plot height to avoid truncating long forecast names
  in total metric plots. (:issue:`576`) (:pull:`581`) (:pull:`582`)
* Fix GEFS file fetching for upgraded model (:issue:`544`) (:pull:`584`)

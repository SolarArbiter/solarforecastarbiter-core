1.0.11 (December 13, 2021)
--------------------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Updated Plotly version to 4.9 which uses Kaleido for pdf plot
  rendering. Use of Kaleido removes the need for starting an Orca
  server when generating reports and is available as a pip installable
  package with no other dependencies. This update also improves
  performance and reliability of the report computation process.

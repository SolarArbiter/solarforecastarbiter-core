.. py:currentmodule:: solarforecastarbiter


1.0.5 (August ??, 2021)
-----------------------

Fixed
~~~~~
* Plane of array irradiance was not correctly calculated in
  :py:func:`~.pvmodel.calculate_poa_effective_explicit`. Function
  failed to project DNI into the plane of the array. Affected code
  includes reference forecasts for PV power plants and persistence of
  clear sky index for PV power plants.
  (:issue:`718`, :issue:`522`, :pull:`719`)
* Added missing ``jinja2`` and ``pytz`` dependencies. We got away with
  it because other dependencies pulled in these packages.
  (:issue:`715`, :pull:`720`)

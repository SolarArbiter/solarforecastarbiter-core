1.0.5 (August ??, 2021)
-----------------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Added ability to limit maximum number of reference persistend forecasts created
  in one run. This was motivated by timeouts caused when an observation was
  suddenly provided a large amount of data and we attempted to create catch up
  forecasts. (:issue:`727`, :pull:`727`)

Fixed
~~~~~
* Plane of array irradiance was not correctly calculated in
  :py:func:`~.pvmodel.calculate_poa_effective_explicit`. Function
  failed to project DNI into the plane of the array. Affected code
  includes reference forecasts for PV power plants and persistence of
  clear sky index for PV power plants.
  (:issue:`718`, :issue:`522`, :pull:`719`)
* Added missing ``jinja2`` and ``pytz`` dependencies. We got away with
  it because other dependencies pulled in these packages.
  (:issue:`715`, :pull:`720`)
* Fixed incorrect time indices in CSV downloads for report timeseries
  for reports including multiple time intervals. Reports now provide
  one file per observation or forecast. (:issue:`707`, :issue:`713`, :pull:`722`)
* Removed html line break tags from report timeseries csv headers.
  (:issue:`706`, :pull:`722`)

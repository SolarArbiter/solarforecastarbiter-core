<p>
The Solar Forecast Arbiter's preprocessing algorithms apply the following
operations to the data:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Drop or fill missing forecast and reference forecast data points according to the report's forecast fill method selection.</li>
  <li>Apply the <a href="#data-validation-resampling">data validation tests</a> with <em>discard before resample</em> True and exclude
    the matched data. This is typically used to exclude erroneous data.</li>
  <li>Resample the observations to the forecast interval length using the mean.</li>
  <li>Apply the <a href="#data-validation-resampling">data validation tests</a> with <em>discard before resample</em> False and exclude
    the resampled intervals where the percentage of matched points exceeds <em>resample threshold percentage</em>.
    Also exclude intervals where the percentage of points discarded before resampling exceeds the <em>resample threshold percentage</em>.
    This is typically used to exclude intervals that contain valid but undesirable data, such as the hours of sunrise/sunset or hours that are mostly clear.</li>
  <li>Remove times that do not exist in both the resampled observations,
    the forecasts, and, if selected, the reference forecasts.</li>
</ol>

The table below summarizes the data preprocessing results.

<p>The table below shows the normalization, deadband, and cost
parameters used in calculating the metrics. The <em>normalization</em>
factor is applied when calculating the metrics NMAE, NMBE, and
NRMSE. The normalization is in the same units as the forecast and
observation. By default, AC power forecasts are normalized by AC
capacity and DC power forecasts are normalized by DC
capacity. Normalization for all other forecasts is undefined, and the
metric values are set to <code>nan</code>.  The <em>deadband</em>
accounts for observation uncertainty by setting the error (forecast -
observation) equal to 0 for any point that is within the deadband. The
error is unchanged for any point that is outside the deadband. The
deadband is specified as a percentage of the observation value at each
time. A value of <code>None</code> indicates that no deadband was
applied for that observation/forecast pair.  The deadband is accounted
for in the following metrics: MAE, MBE, RMSE, MAPE, NMAE, NMBE, NRMSE,
Skill, Cost.  It is ignored for all other metrics. The Cost metric is
calculated using the set of cost models defined by <em>cost
parameters</em>. See the
<a href="https://solarforecastarbiter-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cost.html">
solarforecastarbiter-core documentation</a> for a description of how
these cost parameters are used to calculate Cost.</p>

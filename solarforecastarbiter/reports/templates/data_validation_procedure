<p>
The <a href="#data-validation-filters-table">table of data validation filters</a>
shows the filter configuration used in this report, where each row is a
separate filter. Within each filter, multiple <em>quality flags</em> may be
specified.
</p>
<p>
For filters with <em>discard before resample</em> == True, data values from flagged points
are ignored when calculating the value of the resampled interval.
The number of these flagged points is reported in the
<a href="#data-validation-results-before-table">table of data validation results before resampling</a>.
</p>
<p>
For filters with <em>discard before resample</em> == False, data values from flagged points are
included in the resampled interval. However, resampled intervals
are discarded if the percentage of flagged points in the interval exceeds
the <em>resample threshold</em>.
The number of these flagged points is reported in the
<a href="#data-validation-results-after-table">table of data validation results before resampling</a>.
This step also discards intervals where the percentage of points discarded before resampling exceeds the <em>resample threshold</em>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the results of each filter are combined with an OR operation
to determine the total resampled intervals to discard.

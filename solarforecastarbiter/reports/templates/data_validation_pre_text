<p>
  The Solar Forecast Arbiter applied its data validation toolkit to the
  observation data.
</p>
<p>
  For more details on the data validation results for each observation,
  please see the observation pages linked to in the
  <a href="#observations-and-forecasts">observations and forecasts table</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Data providers may elect to reupload data to
  fix issues identified by the validation toolkit. The metrics computed
  in this report will remain unchanged, however, a user may generate a
  new report after the data provider submits new data. The online
  version of this report verifies that the data was not modified after
  the metrics were computed.

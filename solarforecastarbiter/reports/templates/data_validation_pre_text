<p>
The Solar Forecast Arbiter applied its data validation toolkit to the
observation data. The
<a href="#data-validation-filters-table">table of data validation filters</a>
shows the filter configuration used in this report, where each row is a
separate filter. Within each filter, multiple <em>quality flags</em> may be
specified.
</p>
<p>
If <em>discard before resample</em> is true, data values from flagged points
are ignored when calculating the value of the resampled interval.
Furthermore, resampled intervals
are discarded if the percentage of discarded points in the interval exceeds
<em>resample threshold percentage</em>. The total number of discarded resampled
intervals is reported with DISCARD BEFORE RESAMPLE prepended to the flag name in the
<a href="#data-validation-results-table">table of data validation results</a>.
</p>
<p>
If <em>discard before resample</em> is false, data values from flagged points are
included in resampled interval. However, resampled intervals
are discarded if the percentage of flagged points in the interval exceeds
<em>resample threshold percentage</em>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the results of each filter are combined with an OR operation
to determine the total resampled intervals to discard.

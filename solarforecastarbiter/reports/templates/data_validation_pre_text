<p>
The Solar Forecast Arbiter applied its data validation toolkit to the
observation data. The <a href="#data-validation-filters">table of data
validation filters</a> shows the filter configuration, where each row is a
separate filter. Within each filter, multiple <em>quality flags</em> may be
specified. If <em>discard before resample</em> is true, the quality flags are
applied to the data before it is resampled. During resampling, intervals are
discarded if <em>resample threshold percentage</em> is exceeded. These results
are reported with DISCARD BEFORE RESAMPLE prepended to the flag name in the <a
href="#data-validation-results">table of data validation results</a>. If
discard before resample is false, the quality flags are only considered during
the resampling operation. The quality flags of the raw observations are combined
with OR, the total number of flagged points within a resample period is
computed, and intervals are discarded where resample threshold percentage is
exceeded. Finally, the results of each filter are combined with an OR operation
to determine the total resampled intervals to discard.

<p>
  The Solar Forecast Arbiter applied its data validation toolkit to the
  observation data.
</p>
<p>
  For more details on the data validation results for each observation,
  please see the observation pages linked to in the
  <a href="#observations-and-forecasts">observations and forecasts table</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Data providers may elect to reupload data to
  fix issues identified by the validation toolkit. The metrics computed
  in this report will remain unchanged, however, a user may generate a
  new report after the data provider submits new data. The online
  version of this report verifies that the data was not modified after
  the metrics were computed.

  <p>
  The <a href="#data-validation-filters-table">table of data validation filters</a>
  shows the filter configuration used in this report, where each row is a
  separate filter. Within each filter, multiple <em>quality flags</em> may be
  specified.
  </p>
  <p>
  For filters with <em>discard before resample</em> == True, data values from flagged points
  are ignored when calculating the value of the resampled interval.
  The number of these flagged points is reported in the
  <a href="#data-validation-results-before-table">table of data validation results before resampling</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  For filters with <em>discard before resample</em> == False, data values from flagged points are
  included in the resampled interval. However, resampled intervals
  are discarded if the percentage of flagged points in the interval exceeds
  the <em>resample threshold</em>.
  The number of these flagged points is reported in the
  <a href="#data-validation-results-after-table">table of data validation results before resampling</a>.
  This step also discards intervals where the percentage of points discarded before resampling exceeds the <em>resample threshold</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Finally, the results of each filter are combined with an OR operation
  to determine the total resampled intervals to discard.

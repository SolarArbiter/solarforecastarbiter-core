<p>The table below shows the observation, forecast, and reference forecast
triplets analyzed in this report. The reference forecast is listed as
<em>None</em> if it was not selected during the report configuration. The table
includes the unprocessed observation, forecast, and reference forecast
<em>interval label</em> (beginning, ending, instantaneous)
and <em>interval length</em>. If these quantities do not match, the
Solar Forecast Arbiter must align and/or resample the data before
computing error statistics. The Solar Forecast Arbiter aligns the
observation data to the forecast data. Reference forecasts must have the same
interval label, length, and type as the associated forecasts. The aligned
and resampled parameters are also shown below, including a unique name for the
aligned and resampled observation/forecast pair that appears in
the metrics plots, tables, and CSV download.</p>
